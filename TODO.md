# Project Status and Implementation Challenges

## AI-31: Landing Page Schema Implementation

### Current Implementation Progress

- [x] Extended SiteConfig interface in config-loader.ts to include landingPage property
- [x] Created LandingPageConfig interface with sections for hero, features, testimonials, pricing, CTA, and FAQ
- [x] Implemented detailed interfaces for each section type with required and optional properties
- [x] Created schemas/landing-page.ts with schema definitions using a createSchema pattern
- [x] Added landingPageSchema, themeSchema, and abTestingSchema exports
- [x] Updated index.ts to export all new interfaces and schemas
- [x] Verified TypeScript compilation with no errors

### Technical Challenges and Blockers

- [x] Resolved module type mismatch between ai-functions (ESM) and ai-site (CommonJS)
  - Created a temporary createSchema function to avoid import issues
  - This will be replaced with the actual AI import when the package is built
- [ ] Need to ensure compatibility with both ai-functions and ai-props
  - Current implementation focuses on schema definitions that should work with both
  - Further testing needed to verify integration with both packages

### Verification Requirements

- [x] TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- [ ] Integration with existing configuration system
- [ ] Compatibility with both ai-functions and ai-props
- [ ] Support for responsive/mobile variations in schemas
- [ ] Theme property integration
- [ ] Default values for schema properties
- [ ] A/B testing variant support

### Deployment Status

- [ ] PR created
- [ ] CI checks passed
- [ ] PR reviewed and approved
- [ ] Changes merged to main branch
- [ ] Package published with new version

## Previous Tasks

### Current Implementation Progress

- [x] Created test environment setup file
- [x] Removed mock implementations in tests
- [x] Updated test assertions to focus on structure validation
- [ ] Implement conditional test execution based on environment variables

### Technical Challenges and Blockers

- Module resolution error when importing from ai-providers package
  - Error: Cannot find module '/home/ubuntu/repos/primitives.org.ai/node*modules/.pnpm/ai-providers@0.2.0*@cloudflare+workers-types@4.20250505.0_@langchain+core@0.3.51_openai_2d69c4b9c44813f80dc86b588fa63d04/node_modules/ai-providers/dist/provider'
  - This appears to be an issue with how the ai-providers package is built or referenced
  - Tests will be configured to skip if required environment variables are not set

### Verification Requirements

- Tests should validate structural properties of AI-generated content
- Tests should skip when required environment variables are not available
- No mock implementations should be used

### Deployment Status

- Not applicable for this task
