# Project Status and Implementation Challenges

## Current Implementation Progress
- [x] Created test environment setup file
- [x] Removed mock implementations in tests
- [x] Updated test assertions to focus on structure validation
- [ ] Implement conditional test execution based on environment variables

## Technical Challenges and Blockers
- Module resolution error when importing from ai-providers package
  - Error: Cannot find module '/home/ubuntu/repos/primitives.org.ai/node_modules/.pnpm/ai-providers@0.2.0_@cloudflare+workers-types@4.20250505.0_@langchain+core@0.3.51_openai_2d69c4b9c44813f80dc86b588fa63d04/node_modules/ai-providers/dist/provider'
  - This appears to be an issue with how the ai-providers package is built or referenced
  - Tests will be configured to skip if required environment variables are not set

## Verification Requirements
- Tests should validate structural properties of AI-generated content
- Tests should skip when required environment variables are not available
- No mock implementations should be used

## Deployment Status
- Not applicable for this task
