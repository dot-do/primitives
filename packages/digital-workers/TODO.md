# Digital Workers Implementation TODO

## Implementation Progress

- [x] Set up package structure
- [ ] Implement Worker function in index.ts
- [ ] Define TypeScript interfaces in types.ts
- [ ] Implement event loop in scheduling.ts
- [ ] Add communication capabilities in communication.ts
- [ ] Implement KPI tracking in kpi-tracker.ts
- [ ] Add tests for core functionality
- [ ] Document API and usage examples

## Technical Challenges

- [ ] Determine optimal frequency for event loop execution
  - Consider configurable options (cron expressions, intervals)
  - Balance between responsiveness and resource usage
  
- [ ] Design KPI evaluation system
  - Create flexible comparison mechanism for different metric types
  - Implement weighted scoring for multiple KPIs
  
- [ ] Implement secure communication authentication
  - Handle token storage and management
  - Support multiple authentication methods per channel
  
- [ ] Determine persistence mechanism for context and memory
  - Evaluate options for state persistence
  - Consider leveraging existing agent memory systems

## Verification Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for all core functions
- [ ] Integration tests for Worker with Agent
- [ ] Test event loop scheduling with different configurations
- [ ] Verify communication channel integrations
- [ ] Test KPI evaluation against various OKR targets

## Deployment Status

- [ ] Package published to npm
- [ ] Documentation updated on primitives.org.ai
- [ ] Example implementations created
