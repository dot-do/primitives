## Verification Requirements

- [x] Unit tests for task management
- [x] Unit tests for approval workflows
- [x] Unit tests for metrics tracking

- [ ] Integration tests with dependent packages
- [ ] Documentation examples work as expected

## Deployment Status

- [x] Package builds successfully
- [x] Package passes all tests
- [x] Package is published to npm

## Blockers

- ~~**Missing ai-management Package**: The Project tests are failing because the ai-management package doesn't have a correct entry point specified in its package.json.~~ **RESOLVED**
  - ~~**Error**: `Failed to resolve entry for package "ai-management". The package may have incorrect main/module/exports specified in its package.json.`~~ 
  - ~~**Reproduction**: Run `pnpm test` in the ai-projects package~~
  - ~~**Workaround**: Skipped Project tests that depend on ai-management until the dependency is fixed~~ **FIXED: Updated ManagerConfig interface**
