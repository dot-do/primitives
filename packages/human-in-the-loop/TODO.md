## Technical Challenges and Blockers

- [ ] Need to implement real platform integrations (currently mocked)
- [ ] Need to add proper error handling and timeout mechanisms
- [ ] Need to implement persistent storage for responses

## Verification Requirements

- [x] Basic unit tests for factory function
- [ ] Integration tests for each platform
- [ ] End-to-end tests with real platform integrations
- [ ] Performance tests for large-scale usage

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add more customization options for each platform
- [ ] Create example applications
- [ ] Add support for more platforms (Discord, Telegram, etc.)
- [ ] Implement webhook handlers for platform callbacks
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and throttling
