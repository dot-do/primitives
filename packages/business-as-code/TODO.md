# business-as-code Implementation TODO

## Current Implementation Status

- [x] Created package structure
- [x] Implemented package.json with basic configuration
- [x] Implemented tsup.config.ts for build configuration
- [x] Implemented tsconfig.json
- [x] Created types.ts with BusinessConfig interface
- [x] Implemented Business function in index.ts
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Implement actual dependencies for human-AI collaboration
- [ ] Test integration with other packages

## Technical Challenges and Blockers

- The package currently uses placeholder types for `Agent`, `Human`, and `Workflow` since the actual dependencies (`agents.do`, `humans.do`, `workflows.do`) don't exist yet
- Need to implement or find suitable replacements for these dependencies
- The Business function implementation is a proof of concept and needs to be expanded with actual functionality

## Verification Requirements

- Ensure the package builds correctly
- Verify TypeScript types are generated correctly
- Test integration with other packages when dependencies are available

## Next Steps

- Replace placeholder types with actual implementations when dependencies are available
- Expand the Business function with more comprehensive features
- Add tests for the Business function
- Integrate with existing systems and workflows
