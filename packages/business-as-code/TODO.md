# business-as-code Implementation TODO

## Current Implementation Status

- [x] Created package structure
- [x] Implemented package.json with basic configuration
- [x] Implemented tsup.config.ts for build configuration
- [x] Implemented tsconfig.json
- [x] Created types.ts with BusinessConfig interface
- [x] Implemented Business function in index.ts
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md
- [x] Implement actual dependencies for human-AI collaboration
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite with vitest
- [x] Implemented real Agent, Human, and Workflow classes
- [x] Added event handling and task management
- [x] Added metrics tracking and system integration
- [ ] Test integration with other packages in production

## Technical Challenges and Blockers

- ~~The package currently uses placeholder types for `Agent`, `Human`, and `Workflow` since the actual dependencies (`agents.do`, `humans.do`, `workflows.do`) don't exist yet~~ ✅ RESOLVED
- ~~Need to implement or find suitable replacements for these dependencies~~ ✅ RESOLVED  
- ~~The Business function implementation is a proof of concept and needs to be expanded with actual functionality~~ ✅ RESOLVED

## Verification Requirements

- [x] Ensure the package builds correctly
- [x] Verify TypeScript types are generated correctly
- [x] Added comprehensive test suite with 100+ test cases
- [ ] Test integration with other packages when dependencies are available

## Next Steps

- ~~Replace placeholder types with actual implementations when dependencies are available~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Expand the Business function with more comprehensive features~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- ~~Add tests for the Business function~~ ✅ COMPLETED
- Integrate with existing systems and workflows
- Add performance benchmarks
- Add integration tests with other packages
- Add documentation for advanced use cases
