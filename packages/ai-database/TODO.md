# AI-Database Package TODO

## Implementation Progress

- [x] Basic executeFunction workflow structure
- [x] Status updates throughout the workflow
  - [x] Update status to "Processing" at the beginning of execution
  - [x] Update to "Success" when completed successfully
  - [x] Update to "Error" when errors occur
- [x] Object generation handling
  - [x] Uncomment and fix the commented-out code for Thing creation in the object generation case
  - [x] Ensure proper error handling for JSON parsing
- [x] Thing record creation
  - [x] Create corresponding Thing records for text generations
  - [x] Create corresponding Thing records for object generations
  - [x] Link generated Things to their respective generations

## Technical Challenges and Blockers

- Ensuring proper error handling for JSON parsing in object generation
- Maintaining consistency between Events and Things collections

## Verification Requirements

- Status updates should be properly reflected in the Events collection
- Thing records should be created for all generations
- Object generation should handle JSON parsing errors gracefully

## Deployment Status

- Not yet deployed, pending implementation of the above tasks
