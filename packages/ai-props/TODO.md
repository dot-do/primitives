# AI Props Implementation Plan

## Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Setup Package Structure

  - [x] Create basic directory structure
  - [ ] Create package.json with dependencies
  - [ ] Configure TypeScript (tsconfig.json)
  - [ ] Setup build process

- [ ] Core Component Implementation

  - [ ] Create AI.tsx component
    - [ ] Implement basic component structure
    - [ ] Add state management for results and streaming status
    - [ ] Implement model resolution (string vs object)
    - [ ] Add schema handling
  - [ ] Implement non-streaming mode
    - [ ] Mirror generateObject function from ai-functions
    - [ ] Handle object spreading to children
  - [ ] Implement streaming mode
    - [ ] Based on createListIterator implementation
    - [ ] Handle partial/incomplete results during streaming
    - [ ] Manage streaming state

- [ ] Type Definitions

  - [ ] Define AIProps interface
  - [ ] Create utility types for schema handling
  - [ ] Add proper typing for children render props

- [ ] Error Handling

  - [ ] Implement error states
  - [ ] Add error boundaries
  - [ ] Handle network and API errors

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Setup testing environment
  - [ ] Write unit tests for AI component
  - [ ] Test with different model configurations
  - [ ] Test streaming functionality

## Technical Challenges

- [ ] Handling partial results during streaming

  - Need to parse incomplete JSON and update state incrementally
  - Must handle potential parsing errors gracefully

- [ ] Schema conversion

  - Converting simple object schemas to Zod schemas
  - Handling pipe-separated string options as enums

- [ ] API proxy mode
  - Supporting both direct API calls and proxy endpoints
  - Maintaining consistent behavior across both modes

## Verification Requirements

- [ ] Verify component works with string-based model names
- [ ] Verify component works with provider-specific model objects
- [ ] Verify streaming functionality works correctly
- [ ] Verify schema handling works with both simple objects and Zod schemas
- [ ] Verify error handling works correctly
- [ ] Verify array output mode with grid support

## Design Decisions

- Schema handling: Provide a convenience interface for schema definition without requiring direct Zod imports
- Streaming implementation: Use buffer approach similar to createListIterator
- Error handling: Propagate errors to parent components with appropriate context
- Model resolution: Support both string-based models and provider-specific model objects
