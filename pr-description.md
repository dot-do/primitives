# AI-70: Implement Test Suite for ai-database Package

This PR implements a comprehensive test suite for the `ai-database` package as described in ticket AI-70. The package previously had no tests, and this PR adds test infrastructure and tests for database configuration, collections, workflows, and AI integrations.

## Changes

- Set up Vitest configuration for the ai-database package
- Updated package.json with test scripts and dependencies
- Created a test directory structure mirroring the src structure
- Implemented unit tests for database configuration with vector embedding support
- Implemented unit tests for collections (Functions, Generations)
- Implemented integration tests for workflows (executeFunction)
- Set up proper mocking for external dependencies (AI services)
- Added test documentation in README.md

## Test Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation (collections, database config, AI lib)
- **Integration Tests**: Test workflows with mocked dependencies
- **Mocking**: Mock AI service responses for deterministic testing

## How to Test

Run the tests using:

```bash
cd packages/ai-database
pnpm test
```

For test coverage:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```
