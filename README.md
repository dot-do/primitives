## Installation

You can install any of the primitives using npm, yarn, or pnpm:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install ai-database ai-functions ai-props

# Using yarn
yarn add ai-database ai-functions ai-props

# Using pnpm
pnpm add ai-database ai-functions ai-props
```

Each primitive can be installed individually based on your needs.
