# AI Database

AI Database is a minimalistic package that exports Payload CMS collection configurations and Next.js API route handlers to simplify database operations in AI applications. It provides a foundation for storing and retrieving data related to AI models, functions, generations, and more.

The package includes collection definitions for entities like Nouns, Verbs, Things, Events, Functions, Models, and Generations, making it easy to organize AI-related data and integrate it with your applications.

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { db } from 'ai-database'

// Find a user by email
const user = await db.users.findOne({ email: 'user@example.com' })

// Create a new user
const newUser = await db.users.create({
  email: 'new-user@example.com',
  password: 'password',
})

// Store an AI generation result
const generation = await db.generations.create({
  provider: 'openai',
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  input: 'Generate a product description',
  output: 'A revolutionary product that transforms...',
})
```
