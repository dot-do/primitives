# Next.js Platform Examples

This directory contains example Next.js applications demonstrating deployment across different hosting platforms.

## Purpose

These examples showcase how to deploy the same Next.js application to various platforms, highlighting platform-specific configurations and deployment processes. They serve as a reference for developers looking to understand the differences and similarities between deployment options.

## Examples

### [Base Application](./base-app)

A shared base Next.js application with minimal but representative functionality that serves as the foundation for all platform-specific examples.

### [Vercel Example](./vercel-example)

Demonstrates deploying a Next.js application to Vercel, which provides the most seamless experience as Next.js is developed by Vercel.

### [Cloudflare Example](./cloudflare-example)

Shows how to deploy a Next.js application to Cloudflare Pages using OpenNext, leveraging Cloudflare's global network and edge capabilities.

### [Netlify Example](./netlify-example)

Illustrates deploying a Next.js application to Netlify using their Next.js Runtime, which provides a zero-configuration deployment experience.

### [AWS Example](./aws-example)

Demonstrates deploying a Next.js application to AWS using OpenNext, which adapts Next.js applications to run on AWS Lambda, CloudFront, and S3.

## Database Examples

The repository also includes examples of Next.js applications with database integrations:

### [Postgres on Vercel](./db-postgres-on-vercel)

Shows how to use Postgres with a Next.js application deployed on Vercel.

### [Postgres on Cloudflare](./db-postgres-on-cloudflare)

Demonstrates using Postgres with a Next.js application deployed on Cloudflare.
